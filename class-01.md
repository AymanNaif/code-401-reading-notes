## Pain vs. Suffering
#### It's all about the pain.
##### "no pain no gain"

In 401, you will feel many emotions, mental, physical and psychological So many feelings that lead you to wonder how long?

This leads to pain, not that bad, aimless pain (suffering), but the pain that motivates you to keep going and reminds you to answer the following questions:
Whatâ€™s your perspective?
Why are you doing this?
Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
Are you doing this for yourself?

And when answering these questions in the right way, this will definitely push you to continue and make more effort to learn

There may come days when you feel lost and not understand the topics well, so this should prompt you to search more and learn more about the topics that you will study
#### The greater the growth, the greater the pain.

## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

##### - O(1) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
##### - O(N) : describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
##### - O(N2) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.
##### - O(2N) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically
##### - O(log N) : The iterative halving of data sets produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
